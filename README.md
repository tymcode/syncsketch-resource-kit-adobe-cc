# SyncSketch Integration Tools for Adobe Creative Cloud Applications
This is a collection of useful tools for integrating the [SyncSketch](https://www.syncsketch.com) collaborative video client review tool with [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) applications such as Premiere Pro, After Effects and Audition.

##Premiere Pro
This resource kit comes with two plug-in panels, accessible via the Scripts submenu.

###SyncSketch Annotation Importer
This panel allows you to import SyncSketch annotations as Sequence Markers into the selected sequence.  Its features include:

* Choose from any sequence in the current project, or create a new one
* Apply a timecode offset for sequences that do not start at 00:00:00:00
* Filter incoming annotations by
	* Author
	* Hashtags in comment text
* Assign incoming annotations a marker color by author or by hashtag

It currently does not support importing sketches.

Instructions for installation and use are in the README.md file in its folder.

### SyncSketch Review Creator
This panel allows the work area or in/out range of the active Premiere Pro sequence to be exported directly to your SyncSketch account, initiating a new SyncSketch Review.  It's the fastest way to go from Premiere Pro to SyncSketch, as it will not require any additional transcoding steps from the SyncSketch ingest process before the review is ready for use.

Instructions for installation and use are in the README.md file in its folder.

## Creative Cloud
Some of these items can be used with more than one of the Adobe Creative Cloud applications.

### SyncSketch Encoding Preset Pack
These presets will encode video and audio to a SyncSketch-friendly video format, and once installed can be used from within Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition and Media Encoder.

Instructions for installation and use are in the README.md file in its folder.
